# Digital Business Card Dashboard

This project is a responsive web-based digital business card dashboard that allows users to create and customize their personal or professional digital business cards. It features a live preview, vCard download functionality, and a dynamic QR code generator for easy sharing.

## Features

*   **Responsive Design:** Built with a mobile-first approach using TailwindCSS and Bootstrap for a seamless experience across various devices.
*   **Customizable Form:** A comprehensive form to input personal and professional details:
    *   Full Name
    *   Company
    *   Job Title
    *   Email
    *   Phone
    *   Address
    *   Birthday
    *   Notes
    *   Website
    *   Avatar Upload
*   **Live Preview:** Instantly see changes reflected in a live preview card as you fill out the form.
*   **Social Media Integration:** Include links to various social media profiles (Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn) with Phosphor Icons that have hover zoom animations and tooltips.
*   **Dynamic QR Code Generation:** Generate a QR code that links to a pre-filled Google Contacts page, making it easy for others to save your details.
*   **vCard Download:** Download your digital business card as a `.vcf` file, compatible with most contact management systems.
*   **Interactive Popup:** A beautifully designed popup displays the generated e-card with the QR code integrated into the layout, and a "Save to Contacts" button for direct vCard download.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For the core structure and content.
*   **TailwindCSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development and responsive design.
*   **Bootstrap 5:** A popular CSS framework used for responsive grid systems, form controls, and modal components.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all interactive functionalities, form handling, live preview updates, and dynamic content generation.
*   **Phosphor Icons:** A flexible icon family for clear and consistent visual representation of social media links.
*   **qrcode.js:** A JavaScript library for generating QR codes.

## Setup and Usage

This project is a client-side application and does not require any backend setup or complex installation.

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable) or download the project files.**
2.  **Open `index.html`:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

### How to Use:

1.  **Fill the Form:** Enter your personal and professional details into the provided form fields. Observe the live preview update in real-time on the right side.
2.  **Upload Avatar:** Click the "Avatar" input field to upload your profile picture.

4.  **Save to Contacts:** Inside the popup, click the "Save to Contacts" button to download your vCard (`.vcf`) file. This file can be imported into most contact applications.

## Design Principles

The dashboard is designed with a modern, clean, and user-friendly aesthetic:

*   **Gradients & Shadows:** Utilizes subtle linear gradients and soft shadows to create depth and a contemporary feel.
*   **Rounded Corners:** Consistent use of rounded corners for a friendly and approachable look.
*   **Typography:** Employs a professional and readable font stack (`Segoe UI`, `Tahoma`, `sans-serif`) with varied weights and sizes for hierarchy.
*   **Mobile-First:** The layout is optimized for mobile devices first, ensuring a great experience on smaller screens before scaling up to larger ones.
*   **Minimalist but Elegant:** Focuses on essential elements with thoughtful spacing and layout to maintain a clean and elegant appearance.
